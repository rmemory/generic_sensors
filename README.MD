The purpose of this project is to design a board containing several sensors and I/O such as temperature, light, buttons, etc. 

The initial CPU board used will be the 1bitsy.

For the first revision, a simple keyed convertor PCB will be used to access GPIO, I2C, SPI, and analog pins on the CPU. The connector will be "keyed" meaning, its designed such that the connector cannot be used with the wrong polarity.
